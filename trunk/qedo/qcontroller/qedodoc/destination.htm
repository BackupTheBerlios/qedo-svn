<H2>Edit the destination</H2>
The ability to assign objects on different computers is the principal element of CCM. The <A HREF="qedo-controller.htm">Qedo Controller</A> includes a small tool to assign components on different nodes. The actually assigning of an assembly package is carried out in the <I>Component Assembly Descriptor</I> file (CAD). This destination tool gets the informations from the <I>CAD</I>-File and after complete allocation it puts back the new information. <br>
<I><B>Important</B>: In the current version of the Qedo Controller a directory with name "<B>meta-inf</B>" is needed. The location of this directory should be the same location where the Qedo Controller is started. If the directory not exists problems will be happens by saving the settings. </I>
