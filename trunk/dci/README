qedo dci environment
====================

compiling requirements
----------------------

* the dependency from the Repository (MDA-INFRA) ist resolved by copying the relevant files to ClientIDL:

  Core:
	CorbaIdlTypes.idl, PrimitiveTypes.idl, Reflective.idl (from mda-infra\source\idl) and 
	RepositoryRoot.idl (from mda-infra\source\Core\RepositoryCore)
	
  generated Repository-Idl from the MOF-Model:
	MDE*.idl
	
* dependency from Qedo Valuetypes.h :
	resolved by including <Valuetypes.h> in RepAssemblyManagerSessionImpl.h (search along the /I paths)
	
	Cookie_Impl is using to realise the cookie-in/output of the AssemblyFactory-interface 
	the Repository-UUIds are converted as binary-stream into the cookies
	
* the following environment variables are used:
	QEDO
	MICO
		
* the ZIP.EXE should be in path for zipping of archives (in user defined buildsteps / after linking)
	
* 

project output (also copied to $(QEDO)\bin )

runtime requirements
--------------------
* the following environment variables are used:

	MDA_ETC				path for reading/writing iors
	
* file-i/o
	$(MDA_ETC)\repo-files\	directory for storing files referenced from repository
	
	$(MDA_ETC)\dci-tmp\ass\		temporary directory for unzipping of assemblies
	$(MDA_ETC)\dci-tmp\comp\	temporary directory for unzipping of components
	
	
* structure in naming-service (setting up while qdeploy of dci-assemblies)
