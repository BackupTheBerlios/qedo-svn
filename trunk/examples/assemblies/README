The dining_philosophers packages are the first examples of an assembly package that
can be automatically deployed by the Qedo runtime and deployment infrastructure
based on the CCM specification. The intention is to show how assembly packages are
deployed using Qedo. Although each package contains the complete implementation code for 
the components for mico as well as for orbacus ORB, the .cad files differ for convenience
reasons to prevent editing.
The package dining_philosophers_win_mico.zip deploys the example on win23 and mico.
The package dining_philosophers_win_ob.zip deploys the example on win32 and ORBacus.  

Package content
======================================
The assembly package is a zip file according to the CCM specification. It contains
implementations of the dining philosopher components, as defined in the 
examples/general/philosopher example, plus a cad file for the definition of the component
assembly and cpf files for configuration of the CORBA component instances. The 
implementation for each component, i.e. philosopher, cutlery and observer, is a zip
package in turn, containing the implementation code as WIN32 dlls, a ccd file and
a csd file.
The description of the initial configuration of the component assembly is provided
by the cad file and the cpf files. In order to read or modify these files it is
necessary to be familiar with the CCM specification of packaging and deployment. As
an extension Qedo allows to have empty <destination> elements, used to indicate that
a homeplacement, processcollocation or hostcollocation has to be deployed on the
local host. This is to allow generic example deployment without the step of explicit
assignment, as required by CCM.

Deployment
================================
In order to deploy the assembly, the Qedo runtime has to be started on the local
host, including

1. name service
2. ComponentServerActivator (qcsa)
3. ComponentInstaller (qci)
4. AssemblyFactory (qassf).

Afterwards the assembly can be deployed using the generic deployment client. The
command "qdeploy -f dining_philosophers_win_xxx.zip" installs, starts and
stops the dining philosophers assembly.
