The dining_philosophers.zip is the first example of an assembly package that
can be automatically deployed by the Qedo runtime and deployment infrastructure
based on the CCM specification. It is intended to show how assembly packages are
deployed using Qedo.

Package content
======================================
The assembly package is a zip file according to the CCM specification. It contains
implementations of the dining philosopher components, as defined in the examples/general/philosopher example, plus a cad file for the definition of the component
assembly and cpf files for configuration of the CORBA component instances. The 
implementation for each component, i.e. philosopher, cutlery and observer, is a zip
package in turn, containing the implementation code as WIN32 dlls, a ccd file and
a csd file.
The description of the initial configuration of the component assembly is provided
by the cad file and the cpf files. In order to read or modify these files it is
necessary to be familiar with the CCM specification of packaging and deployment. As
an extension Qedo allows to have empty <destination> elements, used to indicate that
a homeplacement, processcollocation or hostcollocation has to be deployed on the
local host. This is to allow generic example deployment without the step of explicit
assignment, as required by CCM.

Deployment
================================
In order to deploy the assembly, the Qedo runtime has to be started on the local
host, including

1. name service
2. ComponentServerActivator (csa)
3. ComponentInstaller (ci)
4. AssemblyFactory (assf).

Afterwards the assembly can be deployed using the generic deployment client. The
command "deploy -f dining_philosophers.zip" installs, starts and stops the dining 
philosophers assembly.
