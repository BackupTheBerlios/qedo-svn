README for the example hello_ccm


In this example there are two components named Callee and Caller, respectively. 
Callee provides one interface Hello that has function say, in which the "Hello World"
will be printed. Caller "uses" this provided interface.
Every Component should be controlled by a "Home", here are CalleeHome 
and CallerHome.
For invoking the function from Caller, we write some code in 
CallerSessionImpl::configuration_complete().
At the end, we write a small test programm, in which the two components will be connected, 
and the say() function invoked from Caller (see main.cpp)
