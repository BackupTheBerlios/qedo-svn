This example shows a tiny auction house.
It contains 3 components; the Bidder, the Auctioneer and the Seller.
An exmaple assembly packe can be found under asseblies.

To start the example, start up Qedo (nameservice, qci, qassf, qcsa).
Please use the --terminal option for qcsa, so you get a extra terminal for
each component server. This is needed for the inputs of the components.

Then use qdeploy for deployment of the assembly package.
