The section to edit qedo.conf you can find in the <I><A HREF="Launcher.htm"><B>Launcher</B></A> panel.</I> It is called <I>Qedo edit center.</I> At the moment only the qedo.conf file can be edit, but maybe the following version of the <A HREF="qedo-controller.htm">Qedo Controller</A> will be including more ways to edit the configuration of <A HREF="qedo.htm">Qedo</A>. <BR>
If the user pressed the corresponding button a new window will be open. This window contains a text field and two buttons(<I>Save Settings</I> and <I>Close</I>). The content of qedo.conf will be shown in this text field. After that you are able to modify the file, but take notice that the currently version of <A HREF="qedo-controller.htm">Qedo Controller</A> don't support any undo functions. The settings will be saved in the file qedo.conf. Also notice that there is no possibility to save as another filename. The dialog will be finished by the <I>Close</I>-button.
